# Open Source Events

List of Open Source Events in which this project participated.

- Hacktoberfest 2022

HACKTOBERFEST IS FOR EVERYONE. WHETHER IT’S YOUR FIRST TIME—OR YOUR NINTH—IT’S ALMOST TIME TO HACK OUT FOUR PRISTINE PULL/MERGE REQUESTS AND COMPLETE YOUR MISSION FOR OPEN SOURCE.

HACKTOBERFEST ISN’T ALL ABOUT CODE. ANYONE WHO WRITES, DESIGNS, TESTS, MENTORS, OR ORGANIZES OFFERS MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT FOR OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
